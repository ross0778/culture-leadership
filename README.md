# culture-leadership
This repository is for a secondary data analysis on cultural values and leadership styles.
It contains the R Markdown file in which the researchers conducted their analyses investigating the relationships between cultural values and leadership dimensions using the GLOBE Leadership and Societal Culture datasets from 2004. It also includes the datasets from the GLOBE study for reference.
Included are three regressions and an independent samples t test to test our four hypotheses, as well as graphs for all four analyses. The hypotheses are as follows:
1. Countries high in institutional collectivist societal practices will be more performance oriented
2. Countries with high assertive societal practices prefer charismatic/value-based leadership
3. Countries with high human orientation societal values desire leaders with integrity
4. Countries in Southern Asia are higher in team-oriented leadership than countries in Eastern Europe
   
No significant results were found across all hypotheses.
